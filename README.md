Three quick demos are included in the repository. 

The first, Hello World, is intended as a basic introduction to compiling and running programs. It includes a very simple Makefile as well. 

The second, PI, computes Pi via Monte Carlo Simulation. A slightly more advanced Makefile is included as well. Finally, it includes a submission script for running on a compute node. 

The third, Parallel PI, also computes Pi via Monte Carlo, albeit parallelized instead of serially via OpenMP. A submission script is included as well. 

The fourth example, Parallel PI v2, demonstrates how you can write some more flexible job scripts.  The example shows how to specify the number of threads, but could just as easily be changed to provide a different dataset, parameters to the computation, etc.
