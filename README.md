Three quick demos are included in the repository. 

The first, Hello World, is intended as a basic introduction to compiling and running programs. It includes a very simple Makefile as well. 

The second, PI, computes Pi via Monte Carlo Simulation. A slightly more advanced Makefile is included as well. Finally, it includes a submission script for running on a compute node. 

The third, Parallel PI, also computes Pi via Monte Carlo, albeit parallelized instead of serially via OpenMP. A submission script is included as well.
